# FastBPMN

The fast way to generate valid BPMN 2.0-models from text-based process models

## Description

This project contains a domain-specific language for text-based business process modeling. There is also a 2-way-generator included to realize mapping between FastBPMN and BPMN 2.0. Because this project is based on [Xtext][7], there is also a Eclipse-based editor integrated. The project is part of a master thesis maintained by [Thomas Lï¿½gler][1], Hamburg, Germany.

## Dependencies

You need to install [Eclipse Modeling Tools (Juno)][2] with [EMF][3], [BPMN2-Object-Model][4] and [BPMN2-Modeler][5].
